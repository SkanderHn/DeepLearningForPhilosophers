Deep Learning For Philosophers
==========================

A few experiments to see if Deep Neural Networks are capable of learning concepts in philosophy, such as which topic in philosophy does a question belong to? 

So far the following experiments have been implemented:
* Training a DNN to categorize philosophical questions
* Training an LSTM to categorize philosophical questions
* Using a pretrained embedding such as BERT or ELMO to improve accruacy.
* Using GCP's NLP AutoML service to see if it provides better accuracy than custom built models
